## Summary

The provided code snippet defines a C# class called `Trybank`, which represents a simple banking system. Here is a summary of its features:

- **Account Management:** Users can register new bank accounts with unique account numbers, agency numbers, and passwords using the `RegisterAccount` method. Duplicate account numbers are checked to ensure uniqueness.

- **Login and Logout:** Users can log in and out of their accounts using the `Login` and `Logout` methods. Login requires the correct account number, agency number, and password.

- **Account Operations:** The class supports various banking operations, including checking account balances, depositing money, withdrawing money (with balance checks), and transferring money between accounts.

- **Important Notes:** The README.md file includes important notes, such as the simplicity of the code (lacks real-world features like error handling and data persistence), the need for proper exception handling, the absence of data storage (accounts are not saved beyond the program's execution), and the reminder to use secure practices for handling sensitive information like passwords.

The class provides a basic framework for a banking system and can be used as a starting point for further development but should be enhanced and secured for production use.
